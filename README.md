# Data Analysis Project - Online Course Engagement and Quiz Scores

I conducted a data analysis project to investigate the relationship between online course engagement metrics and quiz scores. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy, I cleaned the data, performed exploratory data analysis, and visualized the distributions of key variables. I calculated correlation coefficients and created scatter plots to test the hypothesis that higher engagement (measured by the number of videos watched, the number of quizzes taken, and the time spent on the course) correlates with higher quiz scores. The analysis revealed no significant positive correlations. Additionally, I explored alternative hypotheses, such as the impact of course completion rate, device type, and course category on quiz scores. Statistical tests suggested potential differences in quiz scores across different course categories. This project enhanced the understanding of user engagement patterns and provided valuable insights for improving online course design and delivery.
