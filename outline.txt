Hypothesis - There is a positive correlation between the amount of 
time spent watching videos and completing quizzes to User score 
and engagement
Objective - Utilize data libraries to analyze and visualize 
how the Hypothesis is being played into effect
Packages - Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, Sckit-learn 
ML - Create a predictive model based off how many times 
a user watches videos and takes quizzes and predict whether or
not they will complete the course
Outcome -Upon testing the initial hypothesis that higher 
engagement in an online course, measured by the number of 
videos watched, the number of quizzes taken, and the 
time spent on the course, would correlate with higher quiz 
scores, I found no significant positive correlations. Using 
Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
and SciPy, I conducted thorough data cleaning, exploratory data
 analysis, and correlation analysis. After concluding that 
 the hypothesis was incorrect, I explored alternative 
 hypotheses by examining additional variables like course 
 completion rate, device type, and course category. 
 Statistical tests, including ANOVA and t-tests, 
 revealed potential differences in quiz scores across 
 different course categories but no significant impact 
 from device type. This extended analysis provided deeper 
 insights into user engagement patterns and highlighted areas 
for future research and improvement in online course design.
